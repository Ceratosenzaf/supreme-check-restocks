# supreme-check-restocks
This program will live monitor the [supreme store](https://www.supremenewyork.com/shop/all)
(it takes around 6 seconds to loop between all the items in the store)   

It will notify in case of restocks, new colors or new products added.    
(Right now it notifies the changes in the comand line, but you can edit it as you prefer)

Necessary:
  * [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)
  * [Twisted](https://pypi.org/project/Twisted/) (only necessary if you want the script to continue running)

Recommended:
  * [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
  
I built this in a couple hours, hope you like it ðŸ˜œ
